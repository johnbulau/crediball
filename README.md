- **Journalist Monitoring**: Tracks multiple football journalists with configurable reliability scores  
- **AI-Powered Content**: Analyzes and rewrites posts for better clarity and engagement
- **Credibility Scoring**: Displays reliability scores for each source
- **Smart Formatting**: Special handling for "Here We Go" posts and transfer news
- **Error Reporting**: Webhook notifications for monitoring and debugging
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and Twitter restrictions

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Free API Keys

**Groq API (Free AI Processing)**
- Visit https://console.groq.com/
- Sign up for free account
- Create API key in the API Keys section
- Free tier: 1,000 requests/day, 6,000 tokens/minute

### 2. Run the Setup

The bot is ready to run! Use the bot manager for easy setup:

```bash
python bot_manager.py
```

This will show you a menu to:
- Add/remove journalists and update their reliability scores
- Set up Twitter accounts for data access
- View current settings
- Start the bot

### 3. Add Twitter Accounts

Before the bot can fetch tweets, you need to add Twitter accounts:

```bash
python setup_twitter_accounts.py
```

**Important**: Use secondary Twitter accounts, not your personal ones.

### 4. Test the Bot (Optional)

Test how the bot processes tweets before going live:

```bash
python test_tweet.py "https://x.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1951901347219206602"
```

Or use the bot manager:
```bash
python bot_manager.py
# Choose option 8 for tweet testing
```

### 5. Start Monitoring

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will start monitoring all configured journalists and posting improved versions of their football-related tweets.

## Example Output
